# Classification Project

In this project, I compare three classification models and choose the best one in order to predict if a customer will churn or not.

With a given dataset from a telecommunication company, I use this data to try and find patterns and trends with given information plot them in order to better visualize the data and choose what I believe to be necessary information in order to predict if they will churn or not.
